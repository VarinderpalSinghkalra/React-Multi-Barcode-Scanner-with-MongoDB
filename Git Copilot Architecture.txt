Architecture Overview of GitHub Copilot Deployment for AI Barcode Scanner

1. Overview

This document outlines the architecture for deploying the AI-integrated multi-barcode scanner using GitHub Copilot and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. The deployment is automated to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Docker and Compute Engine.

2. System Components

1. Source Code Repository (GitHub)

Code is stored in a GitHub repository.

Includes frontend (React.js), backend (Node.js, Express.js), and AI integration (TensorFlow.js, OpenCV.js).

Uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment.

2. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Triggers on push to the main branch.

Runs tests and builds the project.

Uses Docker to containerize the application.

Pushes the Docker image to Google Container Registry (GCR).

Deploys the new version to GCP Compute Engine.

3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Infrastructure

Google Container Registry (GCR): Stores the built Docker images.

GCP Compute Engine (VM Instance): Hosts and runs the containerized application.

Cloud Logging & Monitoring: Ensures system health and observability.
