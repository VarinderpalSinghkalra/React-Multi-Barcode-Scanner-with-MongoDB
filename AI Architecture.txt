AI-Integrated Architecture Overview of React Multi-Barcode Scanner with MongoDB

1. Overview

This project consists of a React frontend, a Node.js backend, and a MongoDB database, all deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Docker and CI/CD automation. Additionally, it integrates AI-based barcode and image recognition for improved accuracy and functionality.

2. System Components

Frontend (React.js + AI Integration)

Uses QuaggaJS for barcode scanning.

Incorporates AI-based image recognition for enhanced barcode detection.

Handles manual barcode input.

Sends scanned data to the backend.

Runs on port 3000.

Backend (Node.js + Express.js + AI Integration)

Provides a REST API for barcode storage and retrieval.

Uses MongoDB as the database.

Integrates TensorFlow.js or OpenCV.js for AI-powered barcode recognition.

Runs on port 5000.

Uses Docker for containerization.

Database (MongoDB)

Stores scanned barcode data along with AI-analyzed metadata.

Deployed inside a Docker container.

Runs on port 27017.

AI Model Integration

Uses TensorFlow.js for real-time barcode validation and recognition.

Implements OpenCV.js for image enhancement and noise reduction.

AI processes images before passing data to the backend.

Deployment on GCP

Hosted on a Compute Engine VM.

Configured with Nginx reverse proxy.

Uses Cloud Build & GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
